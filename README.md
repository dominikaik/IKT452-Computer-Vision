# IKT452-Computer-Vision
This is the filan project for course IKT452 Computer Vision at the University of Agder.

The topic of this project is fire classification and detection. 

This project was made by Ladan Salimi and Dominika I. Kowalska.


## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the FIRE dataset available at [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/phylake1337/fire-dataset).

The structure was changed to "Dataset" being the main folder with two subfolders "fire_images" and "non_fire_images", instead of "Dataset/fire_dataset/the_2_subfolders".

## Code requirements

The code is meant to be executed on UiA Hub and not locally. Therefore all required libraries are included in the first cell of the Jupiter notebook. Simply remove the comment indicator and run the cell to install the libraries. File requirements.txt is not included.
